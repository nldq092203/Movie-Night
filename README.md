## Development
### Installation and Usage
The project includes a centralized script, run.sh, located in the infrastructure/scripts/ directory. This script simplifies the setup and management of the development environment.

#### Clone the Repository
##### Backend Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nldq092203/Movie-Night.git
cd Movie-Night

```

##### Frontend Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nldq092203/Movie-Night-UI.git
cd Movie-Night-UI
```
#### Usage Guide
##### View All Commands
To view all available commands for the centralized run.sh script, run:
``` bash
./infrastructure/scripts/run.sh help
```

##### Start the Development Environment
``` bash
./infrastructure/scripts/run.sh dev
```

##### Generate TLS Certificates
``` bash
./infrastructure/scripts/run.sh create-tls-certs
```

##### Add TLS Certificates to Trusted Store
Ensure that the self-signed certificate is recognized as valid by your system, eliminating browser security warnings for HTTPS connections
``` bash
./infrastructure/scripts/run.sh add-trusted-cert
```

##### View Logs for a Specific Service
``` bash
./infrastructure/scripts/run.sh logs
```

##### Execute Commands in a Service
Run a shell command in a specific container (e.g., web):
``` bash
./infrastructure/scripts/run.sh exec
```

For more detailed commands and options, refer to the script itself
``` bash
cat ./infrastructure/scripts/run.sh
```

### API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger/OpenAPI: [Swagger UI](https://web-production-5212b.up.railway.app/api/schema/swagger-ui/)


#### Generating API Schema

```bash
python3 manage.py spectacular --file schema.yaml

```

#### Generating TypeScript Types (Optional)

```bash
npx openapi-typescript schema.yaml --output types.ts

```

### Testing

#### Running Tests
To run the tests for your Django project within the Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Choose the web service when prompted.
2. Use the following command to start the process:
```bash
./infrastructure/scripts/run.sh exec
```
After running the command, select the web service by entering its corresponding number and proceed to execute:
```bash
pytest
```

#### Testing Tools

- **Pytest**: Testing framework.
- **Factory Boy**: For creating test data.
- **APIClient**: To simulate API requests in tests.

#### Testing Components

- **Models**: Test the integrity and behavior of models.
- **Views and APIs**: Test API endpoints, permissions, filters, and pagination.
- **Tasks**: Test Celery tasks and scheduled jobs.
- **Serializers**: Ensure data serialization and deserialization works as expected.
- **URLs**: Test that all routes are correctly mapped and accessible, and that they return the expected responses. 

#### Mocking External Services

Use mocking to simulate external API calls (e.g., OMDb API) during tests to avoid hitting real endpoints.
